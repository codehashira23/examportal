## üìä Data Models

ExamPortal's database architecture is built around three primary data models, each designed to efficiently store and retrieve specific types of information. The relationships between these models create a comprehensive system for managing all aspects of the examination process.

### User Model
The User model stores information about all system users, implementing role-based permissions:

```javascript
- name: String (required) - Full name of the user
- email: String (unique, required) - Primary identifier and communication channel
- password: String (required) - Securely hashed using bcrypt
- role: String (enum: "admin", "student") - Determines access permissions
- profileImage: String (optional) - Profile photo URL
- lastLogin: Date - Timestamp of most recent login
- accountStatus: String (enum: "active", "suspended", "inactive")
```

Additional metadata includes registration date, account status, and login history. Relationships are maintained with exams (for administrators who create them) and results (for students who take them).

### Exam Model
The Exam model manages all information related to examinations, including:

```javascript
- title: String (required) - Name of the examination
- subject: String (required) - Subject or course
- duration: Number (required) - Length of exam in minutes
- instructions: String - Guidelines for students
- rules: String - Examination policies
- maxMarks: Number (required) - Maximum achievable score
- questions: Array of QuestionSchema - Collection of questions
- createdBy: ObjectId (ref: User) - Administrator who created the exam
- questionSetId: String (required) - Identifier for question randomization
- scheduled: Boolean - Whether the exam is visible to students
- scheduledAt: Date - When the exam becomes available
- startsAt: Date - When students can begin the exam
- endsAt: Date - Final deadline for submission
```

The nested QuestionSchema includes fields for the question text, options for multiple-choice questions, correct answers, and mark allocation. This structure allows for different question types (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer) while maintaining consistency in processing.

### Result Model
The Result model tracks student performance on examinations:

```javascript
- studentId: ObjectId (ref: User) - Student who took the exam
- examId: ObjectId (ref: Exam) - Reference to the exam
- answers: Map of String - Student's responses to questions
- score: Number - Total marks achieved
- percentage: Number - Score as a percentage of maximum marks
- status: String (enum: 'passed', 'failed', 'not_attempted') - Outcome
- submittedAt: Date - When the exam was completed
- timeSpent: Number - Total time in minutes
- questionWiseAnalysis: Array - Detailed per-question performance
```

Additional fields track metrics like time spent on individual questions, number of attempts, and timestamps for starting and submitting the exam. This data powers the analytics features of the platform.

### Monitoring Log Model
A supplementary model tracks student activity during examinations:

```javascript
- studentId: ObjectId (ref: User)
- examId: ObjectId (ref: Exam)
- activityType: String (enum: 'tab-switch', 'blur', 'focus', etc.)
- timestamp: Date
- metadata: Object - Additional context about the activity
```

These data models form the foundation of ExamPortal's functionality, enabling efficient data operations while maintaining the relationships necessary for complex queries and analytics.
